            Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape 
            for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction.
             What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what! Wait a minute, where are you going? The 
             Death Star plans are not in the main computer.

                Hang on back there. Red Six. Can you see Red Five? There's a heavy fire zone on this side. Red Five, where are you? I can't shake him! 
                I'm on him, Luke! Hold on! Blast it! Wedge where are you? Thanks, Wedge. Good shooting, Wedge! Red Leader. This is Gold Leader.

            I find your lack of faith disturbing. Enough of this! Vader, release him! As you wish. This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide
             us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.
              It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right.

        <p>Captain. Yes, sir? Tell them we wish to board at once. With all due respect, the Ambassadors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board
            immediately. Yes, yes, of course, as you know, our blockade is perfectly legal, and we'd be happy to receive the Ambassador. I'm TC-14 
            at your service. This way, please. We are greatly honored by your visit Ambassadors.</p>
        <p>
            I don't fully understand. This is a strange place to me. Hey. Wha? Hit the nose! Oh! A T-14 hyperdrive generator!! Thee in luck, I'm the 
            only one hereabouts who has one but thee might as well buy a new ship. It would be cheaper, I think. no, I beg you to help us. We are your
             humble servants, Our fate is in your hands. Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans.. Mesa like dis. Maybe wesa bein friends, we've 
             sent out patrols.Roger, Brovo Leader. Roger, Brovo Leader. Cease fire! Steady, steady. Activate the droids. My fate will be no different 
             from that of our people. Captain! Your Highness? Ready my ship! Please, Your Majesty, stay here. where it's safe. It is clear to me now that
            the Republic no longer functions. I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to the Senate.
